# Does the presence of a CD-ROM affect sales price?

## Introduction

CD-ROMs seem to be the hot new thing, etc., etc.... 

Let's call in all of our packages and get started: 

<!-- echo=FALSE means just the output will show in the doc; not the source code
  warning=FALSE means any warning messages aren't shown in the doc 
  message=FALSE means messages won't be shown ---> 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(psych)
library(broom)
library(formattable)
```


## Data

The source of this data is the *Journal of Applied Econometrics*. It came to us in an Excel file:

<!-- This would print the entire dataset in PDF! --> 


```{r}
computers <- read_excel("datasets/computers.xlsx")
computers
```


<!--- 

This would be a good time to introduce the preview functionality. If they export to HTML the end user can browse through the data 

Also that this can be used to add comments that won't shot up anywhere besides doc. 
--->  

```{r include = FALSE}
nrows <- comma(nrow(computers), digits = 0)
ncols <- ncol(computers)

nrows
ncols
```


<!--- Throw an error in one of these lines to show the consequences ---> 

There are `r nrows` rows and `r ncols` columns in this dataset. 

```{r include = FALSE}
avg_price <- currency(mean(computers$price), digits = 0)
avg_price
```


The descriptive statistics for `price` are as follows. The average price is `r avg_price`


```{r}
describe(computers$price)
```
## Hypotheses

Our hypothesis: **there is no difference in sales price of computers with and without a CD-ROM**.

## Methods

We will conduct an independent samples t-test at the 95% confidence level. 



First we'll visually inspect the distribution of price by CD to confirm the CLT is likely to apply. If that looks good, we will conduct a two-tail t-test at the 95% confidence level. 

## Results

### Descriptive statistics


```{r}
group_summary <- computers %>% 
  group_by(cd) %>% 
  summarise(count_records = n(), avg_price = mean(price))

group_summary
```

There are `r group_summary %>% filter(cd == 'no') %>% pull(count_records)` computers without a CD and `r group_summary %>% filter(cd == 'yes') %>% pull(count_records)` with. 


### Visualization

It looks good: 



```{r}
ggplot(data = computers, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) +
  facet_grid(~ cd)
```

### T-test


```{r include = FALSE}

cd_test <- t.test(price ~ cd, data = computers)
tidy_cd_test <- tidy(cd_test)
tidy_cd_test

ci_low <- currency(tidy_cd_test['conf.low']) * -1
ci_low
ci_high <- currency(tidy_cd_test['conf.high']) * -1
ci_high
```


The test was significant at p < .005. With 95% confidence we expect computers with a CD-ROM to sell between `r ci_low` and `r ci_high` less. 

The full results are as follows: 


```{r}
cd_test <- t.test(price ~ cd, data = computers)
tidy_cd_test <- tidy(cd_test)
tidy_cd_test
```




## Conclusion

CD-ROMs seem to be the hot new thing. Are there other things influencing it?

Maybe premium computers tend to have CD Roms, and *that's* what is really affecting the price. I would want to test this. We'd also want to evaluate the overall cost/benefit of including this feature.
