# Proposal for The Full-stack Analyst Capstone

This is your chance to take what you've learned in _Advancing into Analytics_ -- the book and the course thus far -- and apply it to a project of your own interest.

For this capstone, you'll conduct an end-to-end data analysis project using a dataset of your choice and hosted on your own GitHub repo for the world to admire. 

This proposal is meant to confirm you're on the right track. Once you've turned it in, be sure to [schedule a call](http://stringfestanalytics.com/book-me/) for your one-on-one to review the project and your goals. 

## Dataset

It all starts with identifying a good dataset. A couple of places to start looking are [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

I'm assuming you will use some flat file like Excel or CSV. If you have the knowledge and inclination to gather data from a database, API, etc., you're weclome to do this. It's not required. 



##### Using a dataset from work

You are more than welcome to use a dataset from work. However, you'll likely need to anonymize it. I suggest checking out [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com) to generate a fake dataset. If you need any help anonymizing your dataset, get in touch. 

## Parameters

Your proposal should be one or two pages long and answer the following:

- Where did your dataset come from? Can you trust it, and why? 
- Who would be a relevant audience?
- What sorts of hypotheses do you want to test, and how will you test them? You should target two hypotheses. 

I will review your proposal before we meet for our one-on-one. At that meeting I'll provide some feedback and answer any questions you may have. There will also likely be time to review at a higher level your analytics goals and what might come next.  

**There are no grades to this proposal**. It is purely meant to help put you on the right pacing for the capstone. I may ask you to revise and resubmit if I believe it would help you. 

If you have any questions, please contact me via Slack.
