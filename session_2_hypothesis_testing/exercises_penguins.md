# R Practice Exercises with the `penguins` Dataset

## Exercise 1
Using the `penguins` dataset, compute summary statistics for `bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm`. Display the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values.

## Exercise 2
For each species in the `penguins` dataset, compute the mean and standard deviation of `flipper_length_mm`.

## Exercise 3
Display the first 10 rows of the `penguins` dataset.

## Exercise 4
Perform a t-test on the `body_mass_g` column of the `penguins` dataset to test if its mean is different from 4500.

## Exercise 5
Perform an unpaired t-test on the `body_mass_g` column, grouped by the `species` column. 

## Exercise 6
Compute the correlation between `bill_length_mm` and `body_mass_g`.

## Exercise 7
For the `penguins` dataset, visualize the body mass (`body_mass_g`) differences between the different species using a boxplot.
