# Penguins Dataset Visualization Exercises

The `penguins` dataset from the `palmerpenguins` package contains information about three species of penguins. The dataset includes variables such as species, island, bill length & depth, flipper length, body mass, and sex.

## Exercises

1. **Basic Plotting**
    - Plot a scatterplot of bill length against bill depth, with each point colored by species.

2. **Using Different Shapes**
    - Plot a scatterplot of bill length against bill depth, with each point shaped by the island they come from.

3. **Using Size Aesthetic**
    - Plot a scatterplot of bill length against bill depth, with the size of each point representing the body mass.

4. **Highlighting Specific Species**
    - Highlight the `Adelie` species with a red color on the scatterplot of bill length against bill depth.

5. **Facet Plots**
    - Create a scatterplot of bill length against bill depth and use facets to show data for each island.

6. **Highlighting Outliers**
    - Identify penguins with bill length greater than 50 mm and bill depth less than 15 mm, and highlight them in red on the scatterplot.

7. **Custom Themes**
    - Plot a scatterplot of bill length against bill depth, colored by species, and use the `theme_minimal()` theme.
