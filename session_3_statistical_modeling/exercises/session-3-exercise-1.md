# R Exercises on Confidence Intervals and Resampling

## Dataset: Average Heights of Men and Women by Country

### Question 1: Data Exploration
- Load the dataset `heights.csv`.
- Display the first few rows of the dataset using `head()`.

### Question 2: Point Estimate
- Calculate the point estimate of the average height of women.

### Question 3: Histogram
- Create a histogram of the height of women.

### Question 4: Resampling
- Resample 100 heights from the original sample of women's heights.
- Display the dimensions of both the original and the resampled dataset.

### Question 5: Resampled Means
- Calculate the mean height for each resampled dataset.
- Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of these sample means.

### Question 6: Bootstrap Resampling
- Perform bootstrap resampling (with replacement) on the women's heights 50 times.
- Compute the average height for each resample.

### Question 7: Analysis of Resampled Data
- Plot the distribution of resampled means as a histogram.
- Calculate the mean of these resampled means.
- Calculate the standard error of the resampled means.

### Question 8: Confidence Interval
- Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average height of women.
